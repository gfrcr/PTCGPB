# **License Change Notice**
The original intention of this project was not for it to be used for paid services even those disguised as 'donations.'

In this release, we have updated the project's license. The previous GPL license has been replaced with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC 4.0).

What this means:

The project is now licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0, which allows you to use, modify, and share the software only for **non-commercial** purposes.
**Commercial use, including using the software to provide paid services or selling it (even if donations are involved), is not allowed under this license.**
The new license applies to this and all future releases; unfortunately, previous versions remain under the GPL.

*Special thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/Arturo-1212/PTCGPB/graphs/contributors)! Thanks to everyone else who has helped test or has contributed their suggestions to make the bot better!*

**__What does this do?__**
- This rerolls accounts from creation to opening the first 3 packs looking for god packs. After finishing the tutorial it will add your main account and friends before opening a pack so if it finds a god pack it appears in your wonder pick.
